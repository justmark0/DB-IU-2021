# Mark Nicholson BS19-05
# Task 1
For the first 4 steps:
In the second terminal I has ajones without even commit and when I displayed it in the first one changes was
not seen bacause they was not commited. I saw changes in second terminal because there was local changes that
was displayed even without commit.
When I commited changes of the second terminal changes was seen in the both of the terminals

When I have tryed to update for the first time balance of Alice it is worked. When I am trying to change it in 
the second terminal the 2-nd terminal is freezing and waiting for some input. I think it is because uncommited
changes are in the table at this point of time and postgres do not know what to do, so it waits till commit
will be finished, and only then allow new changes.

For the Repeatable read isolation level: it worked propely. when I am trying to change in changes everything
exept entryes that was not commited.

# Task 2
I got similar situation. When I have tryed to update balance +15 for each account that has group_id=2 first
terminal returned success. But when I've tryed to display the result it returned: "current transaction is
aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block". And no changes was applyed. It is because of dirty
read. Postgres do not know what to so since there is changes from the T2 and T1 trying to change all which
group_id=2 and T2 adding one of them (exp 1)
For the Repeatable read isolation level: it worked propely. when I am trying to change in changes everything
exept entryes that was not commited. Exept at the end T1 commiting T2 rollbacking

# Task 3
For repeteable read I got the same problem. when I tryed to update in T1 I got error "current transaction is
aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block". Then I tryed to display, it gave me same error
then i commited and it displayed normaly. But balance was not updated.
For the Serializable isolation: It worked properly. When I update in T1 it updates all values without bbrown
Because it is not commited and in the other terminal
